        <p class="about-me-bio">
          Hi! I am a Salesforce professional, registered nurse and self-taught software developer from
          Seattle, Washington. I have 10 years of experience in the healthcare industry as a nurse in pediatric
          hospitals. After experiencing burnout and the acute challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic within the
          industry, I decided it was time to explore different career options that support a healthier work-life balance
          and offer greater
          work flexibility. So I took a
          leap of faith and pivoted to software development and the IT field. My goal is to find a remote job so I
          can
          continue traveling while working remotely. I hope my story, though unconventional, will
          inspire other
          motivated women and former healthcare professionals to enter the exciting world of tech and find roles where
          they can reach their full potential
          and thrive.
          <br />
          <br />
          I discovered

            alt="Link to SheCodes">SheCodes</a>
          in 2022. It was a
          great opportunity to take my first steps into coding. Since then,
          I've completed all of the workshops and have become proficient with HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. In January
          2023, I
          completed a software engineering internship with <a href="https://concerthealth.com/" target="_blank"
            style="text-decoration: none; color: var(--primary-color)" alt="Link to Concert Health">Concert Health</a>,
          a leading
          behavioral health medical group in the US. I
          acquired hands-on experience working on real world problems and designed solutions for user-facing
          applications
          within a team of engineers in an
          async environment. Most recently, I have joined the
          <a href="https://trailblazer.me/id/marybkly" target="_blank"

          ecosystem as a 3x certified Salesforce Professional. I have been on an
          incredible journey with Salesforce, and I want to acknowledge my gratitude for the immensely supportive culture fostered by the professional communities I am proud to be a part of:

            style="text-decoration: none; color: var(--primary-color)" alt="Link to Adobe's The Visionary Profile">The
            Visionary</a>: passion-driven with a keen interest in the world around me and a desire to
          contribute to society. I live preferring to see things not as they are but as they could be and creating a
          community around shared values and ideas. In addition, I love being able to wear many different hats and fully believe
          in maintaining a growth mindset throughout my learning journey and continuous professional development. From my extensive nursing career, I possess a combination of
          strong technical and soft skillsets that include: critical thinking, data analysis, multi-tasking in a
          fast-paced work environment, cross-functional collobaration, empathy, and communication. My hope is to
          leverage my many transferable skills along with my new set of IT skills to
          deliver quality products and
          create positive user experiences. In
          my free time I love
          surfing, being out in nature, reading books, and
          travelling.
