        <h2 class="mb-4" id="index-name">Mary Liang Buckley</h2>
        <p class="about-me-bio">
          Kia ora! I am a self-taught web developer from Seattle, Washington but lived in New Zealand for the past five
          years. Currently, I'm travelling with my husband around the world. My professional background for the past
          decade has been in healthcare, specifically as a registered nurse in pediatric hospitals. However, after
          experiencing burnout and the acute challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic within the healthcare
          industry, I
          decided it was time to explore different career options that support a healthier work-life balance and offer
          greater
          work flexibility. So I took a
          leap of faith and pivoted to software development and the IT field. My goal is to find a remote job so I
          can
          continue travelling while working remotely as a digital nomad. I hope my story, though unconventional, will
          inspire other
          motivated women to enter the exciting world of tech and find roles where they can reach their full potential
          and thrive.
          <br />
          <br />
          I discovered
          <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: var(--primary-color)"
            alt="Link to SheCodes">SheCodes</a>
          in 2022. It came at the perfect time and it was a
          great opportunity to take my first steps into coding. Since then,
          I've completed all the workshops and become proficient with HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, and React JS. It's been a demanding but rewarding learning journey and I'm eager to continue
          growing my development toolkit. From my extensive nursing experience, I possess a combination of
          strong technical and soft skillsets that include: critical thinking, data analysis, multi-tasking in a
          fast-paced work environment, cross-functional collobaration, empathy, advocacy, and communication. In 2023, I
          completed a software engineering internship with <a href="https://concerthealth.com/" target="_blank"
            style="text-decoration: none; color: var(--primary-color)" alt="Link to Concert Health">Concert Health</a>,
          a leading
          behavioral health medical group in the US. I
          acquired hands-on experience working on real world problems and creating solutions to user-facing applications
          within a team of engineers and product managers in a remote,
          async environment. I'm currently studying the Salesforce ecosystem and working toward getting my
          Salesforce Administrator
          certification to further my IT horizons. Finally, product management has also recently piqued my interest and
          I'm currently enrolled in a
          Udemy course to learn more about this field.

            style="text-decoration: none; color: var(--primary-color)" alt="Link to Adobe's The Visionary Profile">The
            Visionary</a>: passion-driven with a keen interest in the world around me and a desire to
          contribute to society. I live preferring to see things not as they are but as they could be and creating a
          community around shared values and ideas.
          I'm a passionate advocate for healthcare equity, social justice issues,
          and community building. My hope is to leverage my deep healthcare background plus my new set of web
          development/IT skills to build products and
          user experiences that directly help and empower people and their surrounding communities. In
          my free time I love
          surfing, being out in nature, reading books, spending time with family and friends, and travelling.
