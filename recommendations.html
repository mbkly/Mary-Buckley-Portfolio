                  I had the pleasure of collaborating with Mary on a significant Salesforce project, and I can
                  confidently attest to her
                  exceptional expertise and dedication. Mary's prowess in Salesforce Administration and
                  Implementation, especially within
                  the Salesforce Lightning environment, truly set the benchmark. Mary seamlessly integrated the
                  Salesforce (CRM) acumen to
                  drive actionable results, proving her deep understanding of the platform.

                  Beyond technical capabilities, Mary's commitment to thorough Requirements Analysis ensured our
                  project's alignment with
                  stakeholder expectations. Her proficiency with tools like Slack, Jira, and Confluence was pivotal in
                  maintaining clear
                  communication and documentation throughout the project's lifecycle. It's not just about knowing the
                  tools; it's about
                  using them effectively, and Mary does just that.
                  </br></br>
                  One of the most notable aspects of working alongside Mary was witnessing her exceptional Project
                  Management skills. Mary
                  effortlessly combined leadership, teamwork, and communication, forming a trifecta of capabilities
                  that ensured our team
                  consistently met deliverables and surpassed project milestones.
                  </br></br>
                  In an era where collaboration and clarity are key, Mary's holistic approach to her work, combining
                  both technical and
                  interpersonal skills, makes Mary an invaluable asset to any Salesforce initiative. I wholeheartedly
                  endorse Mary for any
                  project requiring a seasoned professional with a track record of excellence. </br></br>

                  pleasure of working
                  with her at Concert Health and all I can say is that she left her mark there.

                  Always asking the right questions and up for new challenges Mary was able to deliver quality code
                  while
                  working with
                  different technologies both in the frontend and the backend layers.
                  </br></br>
                  It's not everyday you can work with someone so eager to learn and to help, she's definitelly an asset
                  on
                  any team and
                  earns my highest recommendation!

                  I am delighted to write a recommendation for Mary based on our collaborative experiences in the
                  Salesforce ecosystem.
                  Our partnership began within a study group for our Salesforce Admin Certification and culminated in a
                  pro-bono venture
                  for a non-profit organization.
                  Mary's aptitude for project management and organizational finesse is truly noteworthy. Her planning
                  and execution
                  ensured that our initiatives progressed seamlessly, while her communication skills and teamwork were
                  instrumental in our
                  shared successes.
                  Mary's depth of knowledge in Salesforce is evident. Her grasp of Salesforce functionalities and her
                  skill in tailoring
                  them to meet project requirements are commendable.
                  Mary's proficiency in web-to-lead functionality and her dedication to maintaining data integrity
                  significantly enhanced
                  the quality of our work. Our collaboration predominantly revolved around Salesforce Non-Profit Success
                  Pack (NPSP) and
                  Program Management Module (PMM). With little experience in these prior, Mary took on this new
                  challenge with fervor and
                  ease, adapting to whatever came her way.
                  I would recommend Mary to any company looking for an awesome employee and team player!

                  I had the pleasure of working with Mary on a Clicked Sprint that focused on Business Analysis and
                  Salesforce
                  Administration. During that time, I was incredibly impressed by her ability to balance multiple
                  projects and stay
                  organized, as well as her attention to detail. She was able to clearly teach our team about different
                  software we could
                  use to implement our Salesforce solutions and present our findings to stakeholders. In addition, she
                  was supportive of
                  other team members and was always ready to hop on a call to troubleshoot as needed so that the project
                  stayed on track. </br></br>

                  Her positive attitude, willingness to ask questions, and capability dive headlong into finding
                  solutions to technical
                  problems will make her a superstar at any company. Thank you for your exceptional quality of work,
                  Mary! </br></br>

                I had the opportunity of working with Mary through our Salesforce Talent Stacker experience project.
                Mary is a natural
                born leader, who is not afraid to take initiative. Mary is eager to learn and collaborate with others,
                creating a safe
                and effective team environment. She took the time to work with me one on one when I had questions
                regarding topics she
                excelled in. Mary is patient, kind, and empathic but still addresses team concerns thoroughly.</br></br>
